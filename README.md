Repo for our project. At some point, we need to update this readme.

## Directory structure for now

Apparently we have to use Eclipse for this project, so it will probably create its own directory structure for the project. I'm thinking we can just create an `eclipse` subdirectory for that later, and throw a `.gitignore` file in there for all the extra crap that it creates (like output directories, directories to hold dependencies, etc.). Then we can just move the Eclipse project into that subdirectory and do our commits through the command line to keep things simple.

For now, I just created a directory for us to put our class outlines in. These should be `.java` files, with a class definition for one of the classes in the class diagram. Follow standard naming conventions, which say that the name of the `.java` file should be the same as the class name.
